The data visualization can be exported to 3D files:
  - USDZ 3D samples: [iris.usdz](../samples/iris/result3D/iris.usdz), [eco.usdz](../samples/eco/result3D/eco.usdz), [fruits.usdz](../samples/fruits/result3D/fruits.usdz), [geo.usdz](../samples/geo/result3D/health.usdz)
  - glTF 3D samples: [iris.glb](../samples/iris/result3D/iris.glb), [eco.glb](../samples/eco/result3D/eco.glb), [fruits.glb](../samples/fruits/result3D/fruits.glb), [geo.glb](../samples/geo/result3D/health.glb)
